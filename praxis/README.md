These are my solutions to [Programming Praxis](https://programmingpraxis.com/).

They are written in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/). I use these little exercises to explore cool concepts and libraries like [Megaparsack](https://docs.racket-lang.org/megaparsack/index.html) and [Racklog](https://docs.racket-lang.org/racklog/).
