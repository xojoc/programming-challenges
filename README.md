From time to time I like to write code for the sake of it. Here’s a collection of programming challenges that I’ve solved:

  * [Programming Praxis](https://github.com/xojoc/programming-challenges/blob/master/praxis) - problems of all kinds. Useful for learning new algorithms/data structures/concepts



If you think something could be written better or have any kind of feedback, please open a pull request or write to [hi@xojoc.pw](mailto:hi@xojoc.pw).
